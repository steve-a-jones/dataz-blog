###16 Achievements of 2016 <br />December 31, 2016
As time rushes past us, we sometimes forget. We forget what our goals are. We forget to look back on what we have accomplished. We forget to invest in ourselves.

For us, 2016 was about remembering those things. Our goals were to learn new skills, be more active, and live somewhere with better weather. Looking back, we did just that.

A glimpse of our 2016 Achievements:

###Data Behind Our Coffee Addiction <br />November 15, 2016

With no stream of steady income and a coffee addict on our team, we had our first real-life problem with a simple, data-driven solution. Should we buy an espresso machine? How long would it take to pay off?

1. **Gather the data.** [Mint,](www.mint.com) an awesome tool created by Intuit, inc. allows someone to hook up online banking, broker accounts, etc. into a platform that summarizes financial data.

2. **Analyze.** I dumped the data into Excel, cleaned it up a bit, and created a graph. I looked at a quarter of spending data and forecasted expenses for the next quarter assuming a purchase of an espresso machine & any required accessories. Summary shown below:

3. **Outcome**: We purchased a quality Gaggia espresso machine, accessories, and grinder for approximately **$480**. In simply **3** months time, we will have reached our payback period.

***Coffee Expenses before: $570 per quarter***<br />
***Coffee Expenses after: $160 per quarter***

###Our Story & Vision <br />October 26, 2016

One software engineer (Steve), One accounting & finance professional (Michelle). Today we handed in our keys to our San Francisco apartment, closed the doors to our POD which held our belongings, and headed to Hawaii with two cats. In 5 days, we will begin our learning and project curriculum, which we created using [Trello](www.trello.com). The learning portion focuses on calculus, algorithms, statitics & probabiity, and linear algebra. We will apply our learnings by solving problems, some of which will be logged within. Projects will be created along the way based on our interests.

The purpose of this blog is to:<br />
1. **Projects**-showcase projects we are working on<br />
2. **Problems**-log select problems and their solutions</br />
3. **Technologies & Tools**-discuss various tools and technologies used along the way<br />
4. **Share Our Story**-inspire others to take calculated risks in order to pursue their interests

###First Post <br />October 15, 2016

This first post marks the the beginnings of an eventful journey of two pioneers into the world of data science. We both come from different backgrounds, but have both been drawn to this journey by fate and a deep coinciding interest to expand our knowledge.
